# Quplexity

Quplexity is a blazingly fast and lightweight application that is used to simulate QC's and their logic.
Quplexity is written in C++ and x86_64 Assembly for insanely fast execution times. 

## Description
Quplexity is a lightning-fast and extremely lightweight Quantum Circuit/Computer simulator written in x86-64bit Assembly and C++. Quplexity will dramatically improve the quantum computing environment by delivering unmatched simulation speed and efficiency. Its capacity to simulate more qubits than previous Python-based software would enable researchers and developers to carry out larger and more complex quantum experiments. This improved simulation capacity has the potential to speed the development of quantum algorithms, resulting in faster progress in quantum computing research and real-world applications. Quplexity's efficiency can minimise computational resource requirements, making quantum simulation more accessible and affordable to academic institutions, startups, and established businesses alike.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Install the following to build/run Quplexity on your machine: 
* nasm (assembly compiler)
* gcc & g++

### Executing program

* How to run the program
```
bash run.sh
```
or

```
chmod +x run.sh
```

```
./run.sh
```

### Download without compiling:
Go to ./Download then download the quplexity file, once downloaded run 
```
./{quplexity file name you downloaded}
```
