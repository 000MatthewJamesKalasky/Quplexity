global getMemorySize    ; Global declaration of function

getMemorySize:
    ; Save callee-saved registers if necessary
    push rbx
    push rcx
    push rdx
    
    ; Execute CPUID instruction to get total memory size
    mov eax, 0x16          ; Function number for CPUID to get memory size
    cpuid                  ; Execute CPUID instruction
    
    ; EBX register now holds the memory size in MB (divide by 1024 to get in GB)
    mov rax, rbx           ; Move the value from EBX to RAX (return value register)
    shl rax, 20            ; Convert MB to bytes (1 MB = 1024 * 1024 bytes)
    
    ; Restore registers
    pop rdx
    pop rcx
    pop rbx
    
    ret                    ; Return to caller (C++ function)

Explanation:

    Function Declaration: getMemorySize is declared as a global function. In a larger program, you might declare it in a separate header file and link it appropriately.

    CPUID Instruction:
        mov eax, 0x16 sets up the CPUID function to retrieve memory information.
        cpuid executes the CPUID instruction.
        After cpuid, the total usable physical memory size in megabytes is returned in the EBX register.

    Conversion to Bytes:
        mov rax, rbx moves the value from EBX (memory size in MB) to RAX (return register).
        shl rax, 20 shifts RAX left by 20 bits, effectively multiplying the value by 1,048,576 (which is 1024×10241024×1024), converting megabytes to bytes.

    Register Management:
        Registers RBX, RCX, and RDX are preserved by pushing them onto the stack (push rbx, push rcx, push rdx) and restored (pop rdx, pop rcx, pop rbx) before returning.

    Return:
        ret instruction returns control back to the calling C++ code, with the amount of memory in bytes now stored in RAX.

Integration with C++:

To call this assembly function from C++ code, you would typically write a C++ function declaration that uses extern "C" to specify the calling convention and linkage, and then call it as a normal function.

Example C++ usage:

cpp

#include <iostream>

extern "C" uint64_t getMemorySize();  // Declaration of assembly function

int main() {
    uint64_t memorySize = getMemorySize();
    std::cout << "Total memory size: " << memorySize << " bytes\n";
    
    return 0;
}

Notes:

    Ensure your development environment and toolchain support integrating assembly with C++ code. This example assumes NASM syntax for the assembly code.
    The exact interpretation and conversion of the memory size returned by CPUID may vary based on the CPU and BIOS firmware, so results may not always be precise.
